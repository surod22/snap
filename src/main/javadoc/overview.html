  <a href="http://github.com/wg/snap">snap</a> is a scalable thread-safe
  {@link com.lambdaworks.snap.PushNotificationClient client} for
  <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/ApplePushService/ApplePushService.html">
  Apple's Push Notification Service</a>. Outgoing notifications are
  queued and sent asynchronously via a persistent connection to the
  notification gateway.

  <p>
    A {@link com.lambdaworks.snap.PushNotificationClient PushNotificationClient}
    is designed to be long-lived, and if the connection is lost will reconnect
    until {@link com.lambdaworks.snap.PushNotificationClient#shutdown shutdown}
    is called. Pending notifications will be (re)sent afer successful reconnection.

    PushNotificationClient will automatically connect to the APNS Feedback
    Service at a configurable interval and deliver any feedback notifications
    to all registered {@link com.lambdaworks.snap.FeedbackListener listeners}.
